# How to Play and Win
After Starting the game, you must choose an avatar (Bandit, Garbage, or a Rectangle) by their respective buttons which are displayed on the avatar screen. If you choose to be the rectangle, you can press S in order to change the color of the rectangle to a random color. After choosing an avatar, Level 1 will begin. It is your goal to guide your avatar with the arrows to the finish line without touching any of the colored barriers. You may touch the boundaries of the screen without losing, but if you touch a barrier, a game over screen will be displayed. Once you hit the finish line, you will be shown a level 1 win screen, where it prompts you to continue to level 2. Same rules apply in level 2, besides the level being more difficult. There is also a teleport area which you must hit in order to continue to the second half of the level. Once you beat level 2, you have beaten the game. At any point in the game, you can reset the game to the main screen by pressing SELECT.
